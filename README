# Skip-it

Goolge Play Music is a great online streaming service, but won't skip disliked
songs automatically. I've filed this feature request for months, but it's still
missing. So I wrote this little extension to solve the problem by myself.

This extension currently works with Chrome, just add this folder as unpacked
extension.

If anything goes wrong, post an issue please.
